# Push Pickup

A passion project by [Donny Winston](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/donny-winston/8/951/552) and Stewart McCoy [@stewartmccoy](http://twitter.com/stewartmccoy).

This is an open source project and we'd love to talk with you if you're interested in contributing. Be sure to check out our issue tracker and see more below.

Stewart would love if you emailed him at mccoy dot stewart at gmail dot com.

## Development

This project uses Meteor, http://www.meteor.com, an awesome open-source platform for developing web apps. To start hacking,

    git clone https://github.com/pushpickup/pushpickup.git
    cd pushpickup
    sudo bash ./config/development/env.setup

Load `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser and play around.

The `devel` branch is the "stable" edge, from which feature branches (such as `new-mobile-rough`) are created and merged, and corresponds to what is (or should be) up at [pushpickup.meteor.com](http://pushpickup.meteor.com)

The `master` branch corresponds to what is (or should be) up at [pushpickup.com](http://pushpickup.com).

If you have an issue with the code, please [let us know](https://github.com/dwinston/pushpickup/issues/new). :)
